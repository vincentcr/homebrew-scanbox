  def install
    # scanner resolves its own location through symlinks, so it finds lib/ and
    # provision/ from libexec no matter how it is invoked.

    <<~EOS
      Discover your scanner and save the config:

        scanbox find

      The Debian VM is created on first scan (a few minutes, once) and stops
      itself after 60 idle minutes. Scans land in ~/Pictures/Scans.
